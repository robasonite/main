# Desk Buddy

This python program helps take the hassel out of getting volume and brightness keys to work on laptops. The goal is to provide a program that people can just download and plug directly into the key bindings of their chosen window manager. Once complete, it will automatically figure out the right commands to adjust volume and screen brightness on most laptops.


## What it can do right now

- Dim or brighten the screen with `xrandr` commands
- Raise, lower, and mute master volume with `amixer`


## Tested on

- Debian 10.6 x86\_64
